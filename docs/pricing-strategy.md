# Pulse AI Dynamic Pricing Strategy

## Executive Summary

Pulse AI's dynamic pricing model automatically calculates monthly fees based on workspace analysis during Slack connection, offering transparency and flexibility for organizations to optimize costs while scaling with their needs.

## Core Pricing Philosophy

- **Transparent**: Show exact pricing based on actual workspace metrics
- **Flexible**: Allow customers to adjust tracked parameters to control costs
